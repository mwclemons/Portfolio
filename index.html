                    I have been a Senior IT Business Analyst on the Portfolio Management Team at Essilor of America since 2011. 
                    In that time, I have been responsible for meeting with business resources to identify requirements for IT projects. 
                    I have worked on one the largest IT projects ever delivered by Essilor IT in the EyeMed Project, the UHC Project and 
                    the Versant Project.  These three projects allowed Essilor to help these partners secure spots in the top 5 market share 
                    for eyecare benefits providers.  Prior to transitioning into IT, I was a Senior Financial Analyst supporting the IT department 
                    at Essilor.  In this role, I supported the CIO, IT leadership and the Lab Management System (LMS) leadership by coordinating 
                    the budgeting process to ensure budgeting and forecasting deadlines were met.
                </p>
                <p>     
                    Before joining Essilor, I was a Financial Analyst at SourceCorp in Dallas.  While at SourceCorp, Michael completed my MBA 
                    at Southern Methodist University while working fulltime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to SourceCorp, my first job after completing my undergraduate work at the California Institute of Technology was 
                    as a Risk Analyst at Hunt Financial Ventures in Dallas.  As a Risk Analyst, I analyzed and monitored the risks of 
                    multi-strategy, convertible arbitrage, equity long-short, credit arbitrage, natural resources, special situations 
                    and statistical arbitrage hedge funds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While my experience and time as an IT Business Analyst has been very rewarding and challenging at times, I am currently
                    looking to move into a more technical role as a developer.  To accomplish this, I took the initiative to complete a 6 month Full Stack 
                    Bootcamp at SMU while working fulltime.  In this class I have developed my coding skills.  I am in a unique position to use 
                    my new skills, my experience as BA, and my problem solving skills to add value to a company as a developer. I am looking forward to 
                    the next challenge in my career.
