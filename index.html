                <p>
                    I am a Senior IT Business Analyst with 9 plus years of experience. My most recent position was at Southwest Airlines as a 
                    contractor. This assignment ended prematurely as a result of the effects of Covid-19 on the US travel industry.
                </p>
                <p>     
                    Prior to my brief stint at Southwest Airlines, I spent 9.5 years at Essilor of America. Most of my time at Essilor was on 
                    the Enterprise Portfolio Management team, where I was responsible for meeting with business resources to identify and 
                    document requirements for IT Projects. During my time at Essilor, I worked on the largest IT projects ever delivered by 
                    Essilor IT in the EyeMed Integration Project which was followed by similar efforts in the UHC Integration Project and 
                    the Versant Integration Project. These three projects allowed Essilor to help its partners secure spots in the top 5 market 
                    share for eyecare benefits providers. Prior to transitioning into IT, I was a Senior Financial Analyst supporting the IT 
                    department at Essilor. In this role, I supported the CIO, IT leadership and the Lab Management System (LMS) leadership by 
                    coordinating the budgeting process to ensure budgeting and forecasting deadlines were met.
                </p>
                <p>     
                    Before joining Essilor, I was a Financial Analyst at SourceCorp in Dallas where I supported the CIO and his direct reports 
                    with their budgeting and planning. While at SourceCorp, I completed my MBA at Southern Methodist University while working 
                    fulltime.               
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to SourceCorp, my first job after completing my undergraduate degree at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) 
                    was as a Risk Analyst at Hunt Financial Ventures in Dallas. As a Risk Analyst, I analyzed and monitored the risks of 
                    multi-strategy, convertible arbitrage, equity long-short, credit arbitrage, natural resources, special situations and 
                    statistical arbitrage hedge funds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To improve my skills as a BA and become a better liaison between business teams and technical teams, I wanted to improve my 
                    technical understanding of software development and delivery. To accomplish this, I took the initiative to complete a 
                    6-month Full Stack Bootcamp at SMU while working fulltime. In this class I have improved my coding skills, my understanding 
                    of shared repositories, and my understanding of APIs and JSON. I am in a unique position to use my new skills, my experience 
                    as BA, and my problem-solving skills to add value to a company as a senior IT Business Analyst. I am looking forward to 
                    the next challenge in my career.
